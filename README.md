# Installation
To run the AI projects, it needs to install Claude Code first in the local or cloud server. I use the Bigmodel.cn coding-plan to do that, and at the same time Bigmodel.cn provides the effective and simple way to deploy Claude Code which you can check the doc in https://docs.bigmodel.cn/cn/coding-plan/tool/claude

In particular， with the deloyment of Claude Code, users in Mainland China can easily use the defalt claude model without using any vpn. The coding-plan also offers GLM 4.5 model by ZHIPU and you can upload it instead of the Claude Sonnet 4.5 if you'd like.

Recommended configuration environment：

Node.js 18 or later version
Git only for Windows
